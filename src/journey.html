  <p>My Journey during this program was intresting their were many fun activity and I like the field trips that their was. Some of the things that I learend during the program was how to do some HTML and also CSS, learning what I had to satrt with and put things in the inside of HTML and CSS. Some of the things that I liked was going on the fild trips on tuesday, I think that it was a nice productive program their was nothing that it lacked off.</p>
